# GlumSak-PasteCreator
A tool that is meant to create the needed pastes for GlumSak

# How to use
- Windows defender could scream about the binary because I converted it to a native exe file!
- Launch
- Open a paste or start creating one. Left are the items such as (super mario kart 8 deluxe) and right are the links for the items/games shader.
- Make sure if you want to include keys in your paste that it contains at least one item called titlekeys which has the links to the keys.
- All files need to be in one archive that means no folders in the zip, just files.
- After you saved the paste you can put it on any raw text file hoster and put the raw link into GlumSak

# 1.0
- Initial release
